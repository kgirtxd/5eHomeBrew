			<p class="flavor">Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn were created with the essence of true dragons as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn (reluctantly) serve true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life. The blood of a dragon runs strong through all dragonborn. A dragonborn’s color imparts many traits upon them, including varying types of breath weapon, as well as scales that closely match those of their dragon ancestor — bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze. In addition, each dragonborn possesses a fragment of what makes up a true dragon. Those whose fragment grants them a tail are often shunned, due to it being considered a bad omen for a dragonborn to have a tail.</p>
			<h4>DRAGONBORN NAMES</h4>
			<p>Dragonborn have personal names given at birth, but they put their clan names first as a mark of honor. A childhood name or nickname is often used among clutchmates as a descriptive term or a term of endearment. The name might recall an event or center on a habit.</p>

			<h4>DRAGONBORN TRAITS</h4>
			<p></p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Strength score increases by 2. One score, based on your draconic ancestry, increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between good and evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). Most dragonborn are good, but those who side with Tiamat can be terrible villains.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Draconic Ancestry.</em></strong> You have draconic ancestry. Choose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table. Your breath weapon (shape, range and damage type), damage resistance, and ability score increase are determined by the dragon type.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Breath Weapon.</em></strong>  You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, saving throw type, and damage type of the exhalation. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 + your proficiency bonus damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases by an additional 1d6 at 5th level, 8th level, 11th level, and 17th level. You regain the use of your breath weapon after finishing a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Damage Resistance.</em></strong> You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry. In addition, green dragonborn have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Natural Weapons.</em></strong> You grow retractable claws from the tips of your fingers. Extending or retracting the claws requires no action. The claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the normal bludgeoning damage for an unarmed strike. You can also use your bite, which follows the same rules as your claws, but deals 1d4 + your Strength modifier piercing damage instead.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> In addition to being aligned to a particular type of dragon, dragonborn also possess fragments of what makes up a true dragon. These blessings cause them to be divided into four subraces, with Dreadcaller being the most common. Murkdwellers are the only ones with a tail, and are often shunned because of it. Even while half dragons, known for their long tails, are generally accepted within dragonborn society.</p>

			<p>You can roar as an action, forcing each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) if it can see and hear you. On a failed save, the target is frightened of you for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. You regain the use of this trait after finishing a long rest.</p>
