			<p>Your time spent wielding a pickaxe allows you to wield it with devastating efficiency. You gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can use a pickaxe as a melee weapon with the finesse and versatile properties, which deals 1d8 piercing damage (1d10 when used with two hands). You are proficient with pickaxes used this way, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls you make with the weapon.</li>
				<li>Whenever you attack with a pickaxe, you can swing wildly, causing your attack to have disadvantage. If you hit, you deal additional damage equal to double your proficiency bonus.</li>
				<li>Whenever you have disadvantage on an attack roll you make with a pickaxe, the target still takes piercing damage equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) if the attack misses but the higher of the two d20 rolls would have hit.</li>
			</ul>
