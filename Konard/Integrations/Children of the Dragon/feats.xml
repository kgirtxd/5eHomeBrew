	<element name="Dragon Form" type="Feat" source="Children of the Dragon" id="ID_DMSG_COTD_FEAT_DRAGON_FORM">
		<prerequisite>Half-Dragon, Improved Breath Weapon feat, 12th level</prerequisite>
		<requirements>[level:12], ID_DMSG_COTD_RACE_HALF_DRAGON, ID_DMSG_COTD_FEAT_IMPROVED_BREATH_WEAPON</requirements>
		<description>
			<p>Requirements: Half-Dragon, 12th Level</p>
			<p>You have been blessed by Bahamut or Tiamat, granting you a lesser dragon form of your Draconic Ancestry's chosen dragon.</p>
			<p>While all half dragons aspire to assume their rightful true dragon form, only those with enough experience may be blessed with a lesser dragon form. This form varies in appearance, but it always looks similar to the half dragon's draconic ancestry. Sometimes it has wings like a wyvern, giving it four limbs instead of the true dragon's six, including wings. Other times, the dragon form looks like that of a smaller-scale dragon of their ancestor's type.</p>
			<p>Regardless, the form drains those who use it, and as such, they are only able to stay in it for a limited time. Afterwards, these half dragons require rest in order to regain access to this form. Despite its power and majesty, the dragon form pales in comparison to the ascension to dragonhood. And this gift only makes them strive harder to achieve their true and ultimate form.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You gain blindsight out to a range of 10 feet.</li>
				<li>You can use your bonus action to change into a large sized form of your ancestral dragon. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. You can regain this form after finishing a long rest. Your weapons merge with you, and the magical bonuses of your equipped melee weapons are transferred to your bite attack. If you are able to attack with your claws, wings, or tail then you can continue to do so. This form doesn't hinder class abilities or spellcasting, nor the use of spell components. In addition, for each minute that you haven't entered combat while in this form, you can extend its duration by 1 minute, up to 10 minutes total.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This dragon form grants you the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You gain a flying speed of 30 feet</li>
				<li>You gain a bite attack, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d8 (2d6 if you were wielding a twohanded weapon) + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). Your bite counts as a finesse weapon. If you originally had a bite attack using higher damage dice then you can use that one instead.</li>
				<li>You gain the effects of the Enlarge option from the enlarge/reduce spell.</li>
				<li>Your breath weapon immediately recharges after you change into your dragon form. Whenever you use your breath weapon during your Dragon Form, you can empower it with one of the three empower options of the Improved Breath Weapon feat without expending an empower point. The rules of the feat remain the same.</li>
				<li>Once per turn, you can deal bonus damage (of your chosen damage type) equal to half your level to a single target you’ve damaged that turn. This only applies to those you've damaged with your bite attack, breath weapon, or spells.</li>
				<li>You gain temporary hit points equal to twice your level. Your AC and other defensive boons remain the same (your scaled body parts can be used as your shield). However, your AC cannot be lower than 15 + your Dexterity or Strength modifier (your choice).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you ascend to dragonhood, then True Dragon Form replaces this Dragon Form. In which case, you can choose a new feat immediately instead of this one.</p>

			<p>Requirements: Half-Dragon, 20th Level</p>
			<h4>Epic Boon: Ascending to Dragonhood</h4>
			<p>All Half Dragons seek to ascend to their Dragonhood gaining the form and power of a true Dragon of their chosen draconic Ancestry type. The following boon is only granted with the permission of the DM, and as such the following rules are directed at him:</p>
			<p>If you (the DM) are using the Epic Boons optional rule from the DMG, then once the half dragon player reaches level 20, you (the DM) may wish to allow them to begin research, training or tribulations which, if completed, would grant them the following Epic Boon:</p>
			<h4>True Dragon Form</h4>
			<p>As an action, you can transform into your chosen dragon type as if you had cast the shapechange spell. Unlike the normal shapechange spell you can only use your action to assume your original form, or return to your True Dragon Form. Your True Dragon Form doesn't hinder your use of spell components, and is capable of all actions that require hands or speech. This replaces your Dragon Form transformation, if you have taken the Dragon Form feat. Unlike the normal shapechange spell, if you concentrate on this transformation for the full duration, the transformation becomes permanent (until this True Dragon Form loses all of its hit points) and you no longer need to maintain your concentration to remain in your True Dragon Form. After losing this form you regain the ability to transform in this way when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p>Your True Dragon Form's breath weapon replaces your original form's breath weapon, but it can also benefit from your Improved Breath Weapon feat.</p>

			<p>You are resourceful and clever for a kobold, although quite eccentric as well. You gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your created traps (found on page 84 of Xanathar's Guide to Everything) deal double the standard damage. You can create a trap once outside your short rests, and within 1 minute. You regain the ability to make a trap this way after finishing a short or long rest.</li>
				<li>You carry six of your inventions with you, and you can use each of the options listed in the Kobold Invention table as an action once. Their DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. All initial damage caused by your inventions increases by an additional 1d6 at 8th level, 12th level, 16th level and 20th level. You also add your proficiency bonus to the attack rolls of your insect swarms. You can choose to panic and use one of your inventions as a bonus action instead of an action, however you must then roll a d6 die to determine which invention you use. If you roll a used invention, then nothing happens. While using an invention this way, you can choose not to cause its effects. You can only use one invention each turn. After finishing a long rest, and spending 10 minutes to forage and prepare, you can regain all expended uses of your inventions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These inventions look like a mess of scrap or alchemy, therefore others are unwilling to purchase them. Other creatures are unable to use your inventions.</p>
