			<p>You are resourceful and clever for a kobold, although quite eccentric as well. You gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your created traps (found on page 84 of Xanathar's Guide to Everything) deal double the standard damage. You can create a trap once outside your short rests, and within 1 minute. You regain the ability to make a trap this way after finishing a short or long rest.</li>
				<li>You carry six of your inventions with you, and you can use each of the options listed in the Kobold Invention table as an action once. Their DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. All initial damage caused by your inventions increases by an additional 1d6 at 8th level, 12th level, 16th level and 20th level. You also add your proficiency bonus to the attack rolls of your insect swarms. You can choose to panic and use one of your inventions as a bonus action instead of an action, however you must then roll a d6 die to determine which invention you use. If you roll a used invention, then nothing happens. While using an invention this way, you can choose not to cause its effects. You can only use one invention each turn. After finishing a long rest, and spending 10 minutes to forage and prepare, you can regain all expended uses of your inventions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These inventions look like a mess of scrap or alchemy, therefore others are unwilling to purchase them. Other creatures are unable to use your inventions.</p>
