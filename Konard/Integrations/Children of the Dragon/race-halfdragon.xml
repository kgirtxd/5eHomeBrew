			<p class="flavor">“HALF DRAGONS? YEAH, TOTAL FREAKS THOSE GUYS. IMAGINE Dragonborn but then more human. I guess some people will sleep around with just about anyone these days, even dragons. Still I had a few in my party, and I can't argue with their results. Once had a Silver one freeze an Orc solid before he could cleave my head. Now, his look was hilarious!"<br/>— Thorzag, green dyed beardless Dwarf</p>
			<p class="flavor">Many Dragons are not only fearsome beasts, but renowned masters of magic as well. As such, it is not uncommon for one to change shape and walk among the masses, or even take a mortal lover. The children of such unions are known as Half Dragons. Not quite as monstrous looking as the Dragonborn, but still very much recognizable due to its draconic traits.</p>
			<h4>PROUD DRAGON HERITAGE</h4>
			<p>Half Dragons look very similar to their mortal parent, except for the horns and partial scales that cover their bodies, as well as their draconic legs and long tails. However, Half Dragons are more known for their dangerous elemental breaths, as well as the gift of transformation. While only a few Half Dragons can eventually ascend to True Dragonhood, some have been gifted with a "lesser" form that allows them a burst of power as well as the gift of flight for a short period of time.</p>
			<p class="indent">Half Dragons color patterns are similar to their draconic parent, and in the case of two Half-Dragons having children the child will often be born in a color scheme of either parent. Though occasionally they instead look like one of the other draconic ancestors of the parents, as Half Dragons are strongly drawn to one another and known to quickly make families and communities. They are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to 6 and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females. They also gain an advantage based on which draconic heritage is more dominant for them.</p>
			<h4>CHALLENGING UPBRINGING</h4>
			<p>Half Dragons share much of their draconic parent's strength, but they are also vulnerable in the early stages of their long lives. The lucky ones are raised by two Half Dragon parents, who raise them into protected communities. Others are abandoned by the draconic parent or both parents, forced to survive or hope they will get adopted by other Half Dragons or by Dragonborn. Though those with a Metallic Dragon parent are more often than not properly raised and cared for.</p>
			<p class="indent">Those adopted by Dragonborn are brought in as part of the clan, and are raised to show strong loyalty to their clan. A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the Dragonborn race as a whole, which is then reflected upon the Half Dragon. These Half Dragons value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. These Dragonborn raised Half Dragons hold mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal, alongside the desire to ascend to Dragonhood. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn their respect.</p>
			<p class="indent">Eventually, all Half Dragons have a universal drive to become stronger. By gaining strength in a multitude of ways, they find that they become more in touch with their draconic heritage, which comes forward in the forms of mastering their elemental breath, or even transforming into a Dragon outright. This form is often not as strong as that of true dragons, except for those that are truly devoted and powerful. Such Half Dragons have "Ascended to Dragonhood", and become true dragons with all their terrifying might. This true dragon form however, is not easy to attain, and requires great devotion and resolve. Those who succeed however, are viewed in very high regards by Half Dragon society.</p>
			<h4>A GROWING PEOPLE</h4>
			<p>In the most recent years, Half Dragons have been forming communities at an increasing rate. This has created many Half Dragon families, and in turn many adventurers as well due to their drive to ascent to Dragonhood. Usually however, many Half Dragons will start a family and have children, with the mother being persuaded to take care of the children, while the father goes out and provides for his family. Should the mother choose to become an adventurer, then the grandparents or one of the extended family will often take care of them. While they are few in number, they are rapidly increasing their numbers due to a high fertility rate and big families (contraception is taboo for them, as they have an instinctive desire for survival and feel that every number counts) These communities are protected by their elders, some of whom have already ascended to Dragonhood, and make for formidable opponents.</p>
			<h4>HALF DRAGON NAMES</h4>
			<p>Half Dragon names are usually based on the language of its mortal parent, as Draconic names are often much harder to pronounce. Some Half Dragons who are adopted within Dragonborn clans will instead be given a Dragonborn name:</p>
			<p>
			<b>Male Names: </b>Arjhan, Balasar, Bharash, Donaar, Ghesh, Heskan, Kriv, Medrash, Mehen, Nadarr, Pandjed, Patrin, Rhogar, Shamash, Shedinn, Tarhun, Torinn
			<br/>
			<b>Female Names: </b>Akra, Biri, Daar, Farideh, Harann, Havilar, Jheri, Kava, Korinn, Mishann, Nala, Perra, Raiann, Sora, Surina, Thava, Uadjit
			<br/>
			<b>Childhood Names: </b>Climber, Earbender, Leaper, Pious, Shieldbiter, Zealous
			<br/>
			<b>Clan Names: </b>Clethtinthiallor, Daardendrian, Delmirev, Drachedandion, Fenkenkabradon, Kepeshkmolik, Kerrhylon, Kimbatuul Linxakasendalor, Myastan, Nemmonis, Norixius, Ophinshtalajiir, Prexijandilin, Shestendeliath, Turnuroth, Verthisathurgiesh, Yarjerit
			<br/>
			</p>
			<h4>HALF DRAGON TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your draconic heritage manifests in a variety of traits you share with other Half Dragons.</p>
			<p>
			<span class="feature">Age.</span>Half Dragons mature at the same rate as their mortal parent's race, but they can live for hundreds of years, up to 1000 years old A few of those who have transcended into Dragonhood however, have been granted the gift of immortality. Making Dragonhood even more sought out after, but no less difficult to achieve. 
			<br />
			<span class="feature">Alignment.</span>Most Half Dragons are similar to Dragonborn and tend to extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between good and evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively) Most Half Dragons are good, but those who side with Tiamat can be terrible villains.
			<br />
			<span class="feature">Size.</span>Half Dragons are often taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall, with males being noticeably bigger than females. Your size is Medium.
			<br />
			<span class="feature">Speed.</span>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
			<br />
			<span class="feature">Breath Weapon.</span>Weapon.You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until it's recharged at the start of your turn, roll a d6. On a 6, you regain the use of your breath weapon. Otherwise, your breath weapon recharges after 1 minute. 
			<br />
			<span class="feature">Languages.</span>You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.
			<br />
			<span class="feature">Draconic Ancestry.</span>While most Half Dragons are mixed, they are always divided into a number of different colors that reflect their draconic ancestry, and provides them with unique abilities. Just like True Dragons these colors are not all equally powerful, and some colors have more niche abilities than others. However, no color is exceptionally different in power from others. These colors fall into two categories, the chromatic Black, Blue, Green, Red, and white - and the metallic - Brass, Bronze, Copper, Gold and Silver. Choose one of these subraces. Your breath weapon deals elemental damage of the type associated with your chosen subrace, and you gain Resistance against this damage type as well. In addition your Ability Score increases as described, and you gain an additional Draconic Trait.
