		<description>
			<p class="flavor">Native people from the deepest deserts, the jinnborn claim they were the fist mortals to walk the world. They say that in the beginning, all the world was a vast desert beneath a fiery sun; in those times, the jinnborn wandered where they willed, and ruled over all they saw. They refer to themselves as the sab siraat, or “people of the path.” Descended from powerful elemental creatures call jinn (singular jinni), the jinnborn manifest gift through their lineage that help them survive their harsh home environment.</p>
			<p class="flavor">Passionate people, the jinnborn seek wealth when they can, revel in revenge when they must, and cherish close companionship always. Outsiders label them as capricious or even savage, never fully aware of the veil that hides the jinnborn’s true nature.</p>
			<h4>TOUCH OF THE JINN</h4>
			<p>Jinnborn are somewhat shorter than humans, rarely growing taller than 6 feet. Their shorter stature leaves them stocky of build, and their frames are muscular and hardy— adults can easily weigh in excess of 170 pounds. Jinnborn skin tone comes in a wide range of colors from sky blue to light violet and from golden to brick red.</p>
			<p class="indent">Secondary features such as nub horns, pointed teeth, or elemental gleams flickering deep within their eyes all mark the otherworldly heritage of the jinnborn. Nearly all jinnborn sport pointed ears, and they are fond of decorating themselves with precious metal and stone jewelry. Thy prefer brightly colored, loose and flowing clothing, appropriate to the burning desert days and brisk nights</p>
			<h4>PATHS TO PLENTY</h4>
			<p>Th core philosophy that drives all jinnborn regardless of their station is siraati a mystical path that jinnborn believe is their spiritual and cultural guide. Intrinsic to being sab siraat is the belief that the jinni who created the tribes set them on a path that would lead ultimately to the Hidden World, a place beyond the toil of normal existence. Th Hidden World is a land of plenty and fulfilled desire, free of the harsh realities of the desert and unspoiled by the plots and greed of the pathless. Sab siraat are divided along elemental lines, like the jinn themselves, and tribes tend to adhere to a single elemental path.</p>
			<p class="indent">Although every jinnborn tribe holds these paths sacred, no two agree on the specifics. Some common elements persist between siraati of different tribes, however, based on the elemental nature of the paths themselves. Air sab siraat are proud and aloof. Fire-based sab siraat are vicious and draconian. Water sab siraat are carefree but mercurial, and earth sab siraat are stoic and driven. Even with these tendencies, tribes exhibit great diversity in customs, laws, stories, and mannerisms. Some tribes boast multiple patron jinn and might therefore represent multiple forms of the siraati. Other tribes absorb members through conquest or marriage, and likewise have access to more than one elemental path. Once a jinnborn sets his or her mind upon a siraati, however, only the patron jinni’s intervention can change it.</p>
			<h4>LIFE ON THE PATH</h4> 
			<p>Tribes of jinnborn take the concept of mystical paths very seriously, and they follow a nomadic lifestyle in accordance with those paths. Whether a given tribe herds camels or other livestock and follows the supply of fresh water from oasis to river, or another tribe rides as a family caravan seeking wealth through trade, literal and philosophical paths govern all. Th tribes follow the physical paths their elders set down, knowing that these safe routes will lead them around dangerous sands, past beguiling mirages, and to safety and sustenance. Other jinnborn tribes make their way as mercenaries, selling their spells and blades as guards, soldiers-for-hire, or even turning to banditry. This is their path to the Hidden World.</p>
			<p class="indent">Few jinnborn turn their back on the paths that lead them through the desert, and with good reasons. Outsiders frequently misread the jinnborn, though that is not entirely their fault. Th jinnborn keep their word meticulously between themselves, but when dealing with the pathless outsiders, the line between what is said and what is meant blurs like the desert horizon at noon. Th jinnborn rarely lie outright, but they speak in terms that allow them to twist their meaning.</p>
			<p class="indent">Also, the jinnborn who leave the open sands of the desert lose part of themselves. Th longer they dwell in cities, they more they take on strange quirks and mannerisms. Remain away from the desert long enough, and their oddities develop into full-blown madness.</p>
			<h4>PATRON JINN</h4>
			<p>Jinn share many traits with genies—the most well known of the powerful elementals—but they are vastly more powerful still. Immortal beings older than recorded history, the jinn could easily contend with the sultans and emirs of the genie courts. Th patrons of the oldest jinnborn tribes even approach demigod status. Although the material plane tribes might worship the jinn, they are not gods or even godlings, and they grant no spells or true divine powers through belief alone. Jinnborn rarely worship any gods, for to do so marks a jinnborn as having strayed from the path.</p>
			<p class="indent">Jinn are tied to one of the four elements, and they dwell on the corresponding elemental plane. Thy eschew the material plane except in rare occasions, either to duel a rival on neutral ground or to visit their patron tribes. So ancient are the jinn that most no longer use their names. Thy do have formal names, and these names have been kept safe by the patron’s tribes. Jinnborn keep the name of the patron a close secret, and it is a deadly insult for a jinnborn to speak the name of another tribe’s patron.</p>
