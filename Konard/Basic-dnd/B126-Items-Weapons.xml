			<p><em>Mom's Love</em> is the signature weapon of Nalista "Nails" Swiftsteel made from her mother's revolver given to her as she set out to adventure.</p>
			<p> You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with <em>Mom's Love</em>. If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of magic ammunition when you make a ranged attack with it. The ammunition created by the weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.</p>
